# Codex of Enchantment

The Codex of Enchantment is an extraordinary item born from a rare and intricate ritual.
Complicated magics in the [Enchanter's Scribing Table](enchanters-scribing-table) transfers the magic off an enchanted object directly into its pages, effectively “copying” the object's magic into written form.
Each Codex contains the echo of a single enchantment, inscribed with glowing ink, that pulses with latent power.
