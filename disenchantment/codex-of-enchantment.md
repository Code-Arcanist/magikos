# Codex of Enchantment

The Codex of Enchantment is an extraordinary item born from a rare and intricate ritual.
Complicated magics in the Enchanter’s Scribing Table transfers the magic off an enchanted object directly into its pages, effectively “copying” the object's magic into written form.
Each Codex contains the echo of a single enchantment, inscribed with glowing ink that pulses with latent power.
