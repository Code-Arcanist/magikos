# Enchanter’s Scribing Table

The Enchanter’s Scribing Table is a magical workstation designed to extract enchantments from items and imprint them onto blank [Parchment](parchment) creating a [Codex of Enchantment](codex-of-enchantment).
Using an array of runes and arcane symbols, the table channels the essence of an enchanted object and transfers its magic into the waiting codex, creating a new repository of power.
This process preserves the enchantment's potency, allowing the codex to serve as a portable vessel of magic, ready to be placed onto a new item.
