# Disenchanting Forge

A Disenchanting Forge is a mystical crafting device designed for the creation of blank tomes.
Infused with the essence of Disenchantment Powder, this forge harnesses the power to strip away the magic from enchanted books, leaving behind nothing but pure, untainted Parchment.
When an enchanted book is placed into the forge, the forge channels the powder's energy, dissolving its enchantments and transforming the residual magical essence into a Parchment ready to be inscribed.
The process is delicate, and only the most skilled artisans can control the Forge's volatile energy, ensuring that the Parchments produced are free of external magic and perfect for future imbuing of enchantments.
