# Magikos - Disenchantment

The **Magikos Disenchanting** Mod introduces a powerful new way for players to manage enchantments in Minecraft. 
With this mod, you can now disenchant weapons, tools, and armor, and save their enchantments for later use. 
The process is simple: using the new tables you can safely extract enchantments without damaging the gear, preserving them in a codex and enchanting a new item just the way you want.

Key Features:
- **Scribing Table**: Craft a table tools that allow you to disenchant items in exchange for enchantment Tomes. This works without destroying the enchanted items, allowing you to reuse your precious resources.
- **Codex of Enchantment**: Store enchantments in a magical codex for later application. Keep your enchantments safe and organized for future enchanting.
- **Arcane Infusion**: Infuse stored enchantments onto new items, ensuring that your strongest upgrades are always available when you need them most.

With this mod, you gain full control over your enchanted gear, enhancing your gameplay and enabling more flexibility in how you manage and upgrade your items. Whether you're looking to recycle old enchantments or create powerful new combinations, this mod opens up new possibilities for magical crafting!

## Overview

During play I normally accumulate a set of enchantment books and enchanted tools that are not ones I will use during my normal gameplay.
So I decided to come up with a mod that allows me to save enchantments and create items that match the way I play.

So after you have gathered a set of enchanted books & tools that you don't want, or duplicates etc, build up the three crafting stations in this mod.

* Create a [Disenchanting Forge](disenchanting-forge) in a crafting table.
* Create a [Enchanter's Scribing Table](enchanters-scribing-table) in a crafting table.
* Create an [Arcane Infusion Table](arcane-infusion-table) in a crafting table.

Once the three stations are up and running:

* Create some [Powder of Disenchantment](powder-of-disenchantment).
* Convert the unwanted Enchanted Books into [Codex of Enchantments](codex-of-enchantment) using the **Disenchanting Forge** and **Powder of Disenchantment**.
* Scribe the enchantments, you want to save, onto **Parchment** using the **Enchanter's Scribing Table**, creating a collection of **Codex of Enchantment** each holding one enchantment.
* Choose a custom set of enchantments you then infuse into the item of your choice using the **Arcane Infusion Table**.
